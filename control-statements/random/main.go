/* The result is strange. Iâ€™m sure you expected another value than 19! It seems that the random number is fixed. (you can try to execute it 3,4, 5 times.
You will still get the same value).To work properly, the random library needs to be seeded.
The seed is a number that is used to initialize a pseudo-random generator. */
